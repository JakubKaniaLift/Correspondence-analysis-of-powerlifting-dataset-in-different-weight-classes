# Correspondence analysis of powerlifting dataset in different weight classes

## Libraries

```r
library("MASS")
library("ca")
library("RColorBrewer")
library("tidyverse")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
```
## Data

Dataset have:
..* 16 columns
..* 41,152 rows

Columns are:
1. name <- name of participants
2. sex 
3. event <- B (bench), SB (squat, bench), SBD (squat, bench, deadlift)
4. equipment <- used equipment in event
5. age 
6. qge_class
7. division
8. bodyweight_kg
9. weight_class_kg
10. best3squat_kg <- best squat out of 3
11. best3bench_kg <- best bench out of 3
12. best3deadlift_kg <- best DL out of 3
13. place
14. date
15. federation
16. meet_name <- in what event the data was taken

### Loading data
```r
lifts <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-08/ipf_lifts.csv")
lifts <- lifts[lifts$place != 'DQ',]
lifts
```

### Cleaning data

We are going to compare only full SBD lifts, that ended qualified and took place at "World Masters Powerlifting Championships".
```r
lifts <- lifts[lifts$event == 'SBD',]
lifts <- lifts[lifts$place != 'DQ',]
lifts <- lifts[lifts$meet_name == 'World Masters Powerlifting Championships',]
```

This way we end up with 5,591 rows.

#### Searching and cleaning NAs

```r
#Checking NAs
sapply(lifts, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

```r
#Removing NAs
lifts <- lifts %>% drop_na(best3squat_kg)
lifts <- lifts %>% drop_na(best3bench_kg)
lifts <- lifts %>% drop_na(best3deadlift_kg)
lifts <- lifts %>% drop_na(bodyweight_kg)

sapply(lifts, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

We cleaned data from NAs that appeared in our lifts and we cleane Nas in bodyweight for the future.

### Exploring and changing data

#### Data sets

We divide our data set by 'sex' parameter, because our analysis will be done around lifts done by female and men.

```r
lifts_m <- lifts[lifts$sex=='M',]
lifts_f <- lifts[lifts$sex=='F',]
```

#### Counting the amount of competitors in every weight class

##### Men:

```r
sort(table(lifts_m$weight_class_kg))
```

##### Female

```r
sort(table(lifts_f$weight_class_kg))
```
